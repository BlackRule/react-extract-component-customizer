Hook into "extract react component" refactoring
Based on  Action Basics Sample Project
I've created this plugin and run it in PhpStorm. When I use other refactorings my methods from MyRefactoringEventListener  are being called but when I do the  "extract react component" refactoring (that I created plugin for) they are not. :( What do I do? I want to create folder with files when this refactoring happens (and my dream is place the refactored code there  )
